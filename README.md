# Kasa clone in Vue

## Clone Project 7 bis in VUEjs

After choose to learn React as my first framework, still I wanted to try Vue.
I think it was the least I can do to be completely sure witch one to choose... 

Well it's not that easy... What I can say is that vue is **fast to get** !

I found that my code is cleaner than with React, but it might be because of more practice since.

I learn the basic and make it to clone this project all in 3 days, so i am pretty proud.

So check it out [here](https://kasa-vue-js-clone.vercel.app/)!
